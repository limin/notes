* In order to transfer the ownership of a used vehicle in British Columbia, the seller must pick up a Transfer/Tax Form from an Autoplan broker.
* To prepare the car for sale, the seller should remove the licence plates from the vehicle as well as the insurance and registration, tearing off the vehicle registration portion and signing this portion.
* The buyer receives the signed registration and gives payment to the seller. Once the seller is paid, both parties can fill out the Transfer/Tax Form. It’s recommended that the seller and the buyer go together to take the registration and the Transfer/Tax form to an Autoplan broker. At this point, the buyer can register the vehicle, licence it and insure it all at the same time.
* If the buyer and seller don’t switch the registration of the vehicle right away, the buyer can drive the newly purchased vehicle with their old plates for up to 10 days from the date of purchase as long as:
    * The vehicle the buyer is switching plates to is registered in B.C.
    * The buyer has sold or disposed of the old vehicle.
    * Both vehicles fall into the same category (ie. passenger vehicles).
    * The plates are valid B.C. licence plates.
    * The buyer carries the signed Transfer/Tax Form for the vehicle, the original registration, the still valid insurance papers for the buyer’s old vehicle and proof that the buyer sold the old vehicle.
* Keep in mind that in the Lower Mainland or Fraser Valley, a vehicle may have to pass an AirCare emissions test before it can be insured or registered. Visit the AirCare website for more information. For more information, visit the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia.
