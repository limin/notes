### Introduce Yourself
Begin the bio by introducing yourself, and always write in the third person. For example, write "Jane Smith is a freelance writer" rather than "I am a freelance writer." State what year your relevant work experience began, such as "has been writing professionally since 1999" or "worked as a consultant since 2001," and list any areas of specialized expertise.

### Education and Credentials
List your education after the introduction sentence, including the name of any degrees you have earned and the institution you attended. Include any other relevant experience, such as additional certifications earned as well as the names of any professional organizations that count you as a member.

### Notable Achievements
State any notable achievements or awards earned. Keep the information relevant to the intended audience of the bio. Authors can briefly list the names of any publishing houses or magazine titles where their work has been published. Business professionals can highlight awards or other recognition achieved in their careers.

### Closing Statement
Conclude the bio by briefly stating any current or upcoming projects, such as a new book coming out. The last sentence should state where you reside, such as "Jane Smith lives in Orlando, Florida." Adjust the bio as necessary when your education, expertise or achievements change to reflect the most current information.
