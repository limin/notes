Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :
```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

Change working branch :
```
$ git checkout [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

Push the branch on github :
```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```
