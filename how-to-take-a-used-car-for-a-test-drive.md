### The actual test drive: what to look for
You’re ready to take the car for a spin. Here are nine things to consider while  you’re behind the wheel for the test drive:

#### Evaluate how the car feels.
Is the steering wheel comfortable for you? Does the vehicle require constant adjustment while you drive? Make a variety of left and right turns to see how the car reacts.Hit the brakes.  Take the vehicle to a safe setting where you can test out the car’s stopping power.  Brake both hard and soft – did the car’s anti-lock brake system kick in as promised? Did the car pull to one side or did you have to push the pedal to the floor? 

#### Put it in park. 
At some point during the drive, try parallel parking the vehicle. This will give you another perspective on the angles of the car and the potential blindspots you could face on a daily basis.

#### Don’t rush through the process.  
A good test drive can take up to 30 minutes so take your time.  

#### Try it again. 
There are certain elements of the vehicle that you won’t experience in the daylight. Ask the seller  if you can drive it again at night to test out the car’s headlights and experience how it drives.  Also, don’t be afraid to take the car for another spin if you have more questions or if another family member wants to weigh in on the vehicle.

#### Don’t forget!
Once you’ve finished the  test drive, it’s important that you take the car to a mechanic for a pre-purchase inspection so you can getan expert’s opinion on what’s happening with the  car under the hood.

#### Decide which features are  important to you. 
Outline which features you require in your next used car and bring a checklist with you to review on your drive to see how well that vehicle measures up.

#### Plan your test drive route.
Try driving the vehicle in different environments such as stop and go traffic, highway driving and smooth and bumpy road conditions to see how the car reacts to each surface. Get a feel for the vehicle before  you leave the lot.  Get in and out of the car a few times – is the entrance uncomfortably high or low? Play around with the car’s accessories before you hit the road so you aren’t distracted during the drive. You’ll want to check the following:
•    Can you comfortably reach the radio, temperature and mirror controls?
•    Do the pedals and seat adjustments suit you?
•   Are the accessories you’ll use on a daily basis working? ie. lights, vents etc.
•    How long does the heat and air conditioner take to reach the maximum temperature?

#### Drive it realistically. 
Try accelerating, decelerating, passing and merging. What’s the engine’s power like? Does it accelerate fast enough for you? Does the vehicle upshift and downshift smoothly and at the correct time?
